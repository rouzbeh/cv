     As a member of the mathematics department, I work on integrating new networks into
     Mipsology's deep learning acceleration platform. I have worked on various CNNs
     (Shufflenet, MobilenetV3, Sr-Resnet, ...), and added support for tensorflow-lite. I have also
     implemented a fine-tuning system for neural network quantisation based on distillation.

      Automated system for classifying emergency calls using the audio signal
      according to their level of severity. My model used embeddings generated
      by Tristounet (Bredin 2017) and fed into an LSTM network to classify audio
      segments.

      I built a model for finding personal data and references to legal sources
      in French documents for a leading law publication firm. The system
      combined output from a model trained using spacy, regexps, and Heideltime
      to achieve 0.95 accuracy. The model is deployed with a REST API using
      Docker.
