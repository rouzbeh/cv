      Understanding the molecular engineering design principles of neural
      circuits, supervisor: Dr. Aldo Faisal\\ I maintained and developed C++
      libraries for stochastic simulation of ion channels and neural fibres
      (Modigliani, available on github) and used it to investigate the impact of
      biophysical constraints on the structure and function of nervous systems,
      and the trade-offs between these constraints. My goal was to understand
      the engineering design principles behind the architecture of nervous
      systems, based on our knowledge of the design of human-made communication
      networks.
